#### Research interests

We work on building future intelligent assistants that are highly personalized and capable of helping users live happier and healthier life.
Specifically, we look at recommender systems that are capable not only to rank the given items, but to anticipate the future user actions and timings of event occurences.

In our lab we use Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and NLP methods to build immersive recommendation systems.
