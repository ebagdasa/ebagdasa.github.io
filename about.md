My name is Eugene (in Russian: "Женя") Bagdasaryan. I am a 2nd year PhD student at CornellTech. I am part of [small data lab](http://smalldata.io)

Before I had been working for Cisco in Boston, MA and Moscow, Russia and got Master and Bachelor degree from Bauman Moscow State Technical University.


#### Research interests

We work on building future intelligent assistants that are highly personalized and capable of helping users live happier and healthier life.
Specifically, I look at recommender systems that are capable not only to rank the given items,
 but to anticipate the future user actions using sequential and interval data.
