My name is Eugene Bagdasaryan. I am a 3rd year PhD student 
at CornellTech and part of [small data lab](http://smalldata.io)

I worked for Cisco in Boston, MA and Moscow, Russia and got MS 
and BS degrees from Bauman Moscow State Technical University.


#### Research interests

I work on projects to provide privacy and security for users' 
sensitive data while maintaining utility for applications that need the data.
